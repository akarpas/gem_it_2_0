Welcome to GEMiT

This is a much simpler version of the game Candy Crush.

It was programmed and designed using the following technologies:

Design:
1. HTML/CSS
2. Bootstrap
Coding:
1. Javascript (used partially Lodash)
2. JQuery

This project was chosen due to its vast challenges. There was a lot of logic
behind it, in order to make the scanning of the gems efficient and effective
so that the matching gems can be removed timely, and new ones added correctly.

The game is played as follows:
1. Press start button
2. You have 60 seconds to crash as many gems as possible.
3. This is done by matching horizontally or vertically gems of the same colors
 adjacent to each other
4. To do this, click one one gem and then click, on top, bottom, left or right
 of it to swap it with a gem next to it, and thus create 3 or more gems of the
 same color next to each other.
